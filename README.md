1. How do I understand what users need and turn that into a working program? How do user stories help?

When building software, the most important thing is making sure it actually helps the people using it. I try to get a clear picture of what users want and need before I start coding. That way, I’m not just building random features—I’m solving real problems.

To do this, I think about user needs in a few ways:

What should the software do? (These are the functional needs.)

How easy is it to use? (That’s usability.)

How does it make the user feel? (Things like trust, satisfaction, or frustration.)

To figure all this out, I like using tools like surveys, interviews, testing sessions, or even just looking at how users interact with an early version of the app.

Once I understand their needs, I use user stories to help guide development. These are short, simple statements from the user's point of view, like: "As a student, I want to track my assignments so I don't fall behind."

User stories help me stay focused on real goals, break work into smaller pieces, and make sure I’m building features that actually matter. They also make it easier to communicate with others on the team because we’re all working from the same understanding of what the user wants.

2. How do I approach building software? What Agile methods do I want to use going forward?

When I start a new project, I don’t try to build everything at once. Instead, I break it down into smaller parts and work on it in steps. This way, I can test things, get feedback, and make improvements as I go.

I really like using Agile practices—especially ideas from Scrum. I’ve found that working in short sprints, having regular check-ins with the team, and reviewing progress often helps keep everything on track. It also means if something changes—like the user needs or priorities—I can adjust without starting over.

Going forward, I want to keep using this approach. It helps me stay organized, work better with others, and build software that actually does what it’s supposed to.

3. What makes someone a good teammate in software development?

Being a good developer isn’t just about writing code—it’s also about being someone your team can count on. Good teammates communicate clearly, support each other, and work toward shared goals.

Here’s what I try to bring to a team:

Clear Communication – I make sure to talk through issues, share updates, and explain my thinking, especially when things get tricky.

Teamwork – I enjoy working with others, bouncing around ideas, and building solutions together.

Flexibility – Tech changes fast, and every project is different. I try to stay open to new tools, feedback, and ways of doing things.

Ownership – If I mess up, I own it. If there’s a problem, I jump in and help fix it.

Problem-Solving – I like breaking big challenges into smaller steps and finding smart, simple solutions.

Time Management – I set priorities, plan ahead, and stay on schedule to keep things moving.

Constant Learning – I stay curious and always look for ways to improve my skills so I can contribute more.

In the end, good teams build good software. It’s all about supporting each other and staying focused on what really matters.
